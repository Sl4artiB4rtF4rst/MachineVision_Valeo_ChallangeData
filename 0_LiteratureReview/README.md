**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [A Comprehensive Review of Convolutional Neural Networks for Defect Detection in Industrial Applications]

  - **[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589380)**
  - **Objective**: Defect detection in industrial applications (review paper). 
  - **Methods**: CNNs, Object Detection and Image classification. A lot of transfer learning based on "popular" image recognitation models.
  - **Outcomes**: Gives overview of widely used pre-trained models (transfer learning) and their performance as well as application cases. 
  - **Relation to the Project**: Understanding common approaches and good practices in the field of machine vision in industrial applications. 
- **Source 2**: [Image-based defect detection in lithium-ion battery electrode using
convolutional neural networks]

  - **[Link](https://sci-hub.hlgczx.com/10.1007/s10845-019-01484-x)**
  - **Objective**: Defect detection in lithium battery electrodes using cross-sectional images. 
  - **Methods**: CNN with and without transfer learning. 3200 images (400 defective) as data basis. 
  - **Outcomes**: Fine tuned models achieve 0.99 F1 score. Own models up to 0.85. The available image data was sufficient to the task. 
  - **Relation to the Project**: Similar task to our problem. Similar amount of training data - basis for transfer learning idea. 


- **Source 3**: [Neural Network for Nanoscience
Scanning Electron Microscope
Image Recognition]

  - **[Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13565-z)**
  - **Objective**: Classification of SEM images into different material categories.  
  - **Methods**: CNNs, transfer learning, classification. Few hundred to few thousand images per category. 10 classes. 
  - **Outcomes**: 85 to 95% accuracy depending on class. Highest accuracy with fastet model (Inception-v3).
  - **Relation to the Project**: Similar image appearances. Similar dataset size. Most results should be transfareable to our project.
