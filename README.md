## Description

The dataset provided by the company Valeo via the website challange data consists of roughly 8000 labeled images. 
The images depict camera (or potentially microscope / electron microscope) data of microelectronics. 
Conductor tracks can be seen with various additional feature depending on the type structure and its 'status'. 

### Task Type

[Image Classification / Chatbot / Regression / Clustering / Other]
The main task is image classification. The main label class of interest is the status/ working condition of the depicted feature.
The labels in this class are, for example: Good, missing and other more detailed description of features, missing features or fabrication defects. 
In addition there are additional labels specifying the type of structure (different 'Die' types) and the year in which is was manufactured.
Consequently multi-layer image classification can be done as an additional challenge.
